* SG holidays

SG holidays for the next 12 months.

We set =holiday-general-holidays= as that is supposed to be the country
specific holiday variable.

This leaves both =holiday-local-holidays= and =holiday-other-holidays=
available for the user.

* Pending

1. Calculate the `in lieu` days automatically if the previous day falls
   on a Sunday.
2. Can we calculate CNY/hari raya/vesak/deepavali?
